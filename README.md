# 📊 Census Data Analysis  
### A Data-Driven Strategy for Growth and Investment

This repository showcases a complete data science workflow that turns raw census data into clear, evidence-based insights for community development and investment planning.

The technical analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, while a detailed PDF report translates the results into practical, real-world recommendations for decision-makers.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how demographic data can be used to guide smarter planning and investment decisions.

Using census data, I carried out structured data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visual exploration to answer key questions around:
- Population structure and dependency trends  
- Housing demand and household composition  
- Transport and infrastructure needs  
- Healthcare and ageing-population priorities  

This project balances technical accuracy with clear communication, making the insights accessible beyond a purely technical audience.

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Analysis

The project includes:
- Thorough data auditing and cleaning of missing, inconsistent, and mis-typed values  
- Intelligent handling of incomplete household attributes using grouped inference  
- Standardisation of demographic variables for consistency and reliability  
- Exploratory data analysis supported by clear, interpretable visualisations  
- Population structure analysis using age distribution and dependency ratios  

The notebook is fully reproducible and clearly commented to reflect professional data-science standards.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Adults aged **35–39** form the largest population group, indicating a strong working-age core.
- Transport infrastructure, particularly rail, is a high-priority investment due to commuter and student density.
- Demand is highest for **high-density, smaller housing units**, driven by small household sizes.
- Long-term planning should prioritise **elderly care facilities** due to rising dependency ratios.
- Employment and training programmes are important but secondary to immediate infrastructure needs.

All conclusions are data-driven and supported by visual evidence.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This repository demonstrates my ability to:
- Clean and structure real-world datasets  
- Apply statistical reasoning to social and economic data  
- Communicate insights clearly to technical and non-technical audiences  
- Translate analysis into practical planning and investment recommendations  

It reflects how I approach data science in practice: not just analysing data, but supporting informed decision-making.
